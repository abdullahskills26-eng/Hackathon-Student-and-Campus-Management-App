"""Firebase Admin SDK initialisation.

Credentials are resolved in this order:

1. ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` — path to a service-account JSON file
   (the standard Google variable; also what Cloud Run injects).
2. ``FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS`` — same thing under a project-specific name.
3. Application Default Credentials, for when the process already runs with a
   Google identity attached.

Initialisation is lazy and never raises at import time: without credentials the
rest of the API (the in-memory instructor endpoints) still has to start. Call
``get_db()`` and handle ``FirebaseUnavailable`` at the route layer instead.
